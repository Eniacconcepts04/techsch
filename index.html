    <p class="statement">My name is Oyelere Enoch a graduate of computer science, from the Federal University of Technology Minna. During my time as a teenager i had an interest in tech and programming. 
        but due to some unforseen circumstances then,i could no delve into it, but on entering the university, my eyes were open to see a lot of oportunities  tech and programming could offer, 
        so that was how the journry started, so I attended classes, workshops, met with people who could assist and tutor me, made use of the internet to learn a lot about things. having developed
    myself i finiShed my first Degree program, and felt it will be a waste to start looking for a job. That was were i made the conclusion that having learned a lot it will be a waste not to use it
    to impact lives. that is why this company was established. But i could not have done this alone without my friends, co-workers, crew and personnnel.</p>
